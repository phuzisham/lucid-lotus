                    talking in hopes that you will relax, let your mind float free and enter a state of massage bliss.
                    In many instances, people may feel more relaxed starting off talking, and as the

                    doing anything to make you uncomfortable, you should let her know immediately. Also, let her
                    know if you get too warm or too cold, if the room is too bright, or if the pressure needs to be
                    changed (lighter or deeper). If something is not working for you, please speak up! This is a safe

                    <p class="mb-0 ms-lg-5">This depends on the type of massage and the depth of the strokes. A light,
                    relaxing massage that does not probe very deep into the muscles, should not hurt. With that
                    being said, there is a “feels good” hurt and an “ouch, stop it” hurt. A good massage, even a
                    really deep tissue massage, should always stay in the “feels good” hurt range.
                    Pain can be an indication that the muscle is possible injured or inflamed and
                    pressure should be adjusted. Also, pain can cause you to tighten up and negate the relaxing
                    effects of the massage. The most effective and deepest massage always works with your
                    body’s natural response, not against it. If you are able to breathe through the pressure, you are
                    generally safe.</p>

                    person to person. If you are just looking for some occasional relaxation, then a session every
                    3-6 weeks may be fine for you. However, if you are looking to address a specific condition,
                    then it is recommended to go more frequently at first and then slowly taper down to a
                    maintenance schedule. Sometimes, more frequent 60 minute sessions can be effective until
                    your goals are met and a maintenance schedule is in place.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0 ms-lg-5">After your session, you should increase your water intake. Just a glass or two

                    used. A variety of treatments and products are used to protect skin from environmental
                    hazards and combat fine lines, wrinkles, and a dull uneven skin tone. Esthetician’s are also
                    skilled in managing conditions such as acne, rosacea, eczema, and dry skin to name a few.
                    And finally, skin care treatments are wonderfully relaxing and rejuvenating. If smooth, healthy

                    <p class="ms-lg-5">Microdermabrasion is a mechanical exfoliation that uses a machine to remove
                    dead surface soil cells and initiate cellular turnover. It was first adopted in Europe in the 1980s
                    and was introduced to the US in the late 1990s. Its introduction led the revolution of devicedriven,
                    noninvasive cosmetic procedures. Today, microdermabrasion remains one of the most
                    popular services employed in both medical and day spas.</p>
                    <p class="ms-lg-5">At Lucid Lotus, I use a diamond tip method. It uses a diamond tipped wand to
                    sand and resurface the skin, combined with suction to remove the dead skin cells. It stimulates
                    blood circulation and revitalizes collagen production, which promotes younger looking skin.
                    The degree of exfoliation depends on the number of passes, coarseness of the diamond wand,
                    the pressure and suction used, and the frequency of treatment.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0 ms-lg-5">Microdermabrasion can be helpful to treat aging and sun-damaged skin, altered
                    pigmentation, fine lines and wrinkles, stretch marks, some types of acne, and scarring. It is
                    especially effective in treating the under-eye area and crow’s feet. Results may include
                    improved skin tone, reduced visual appearance of aging, fewer breakouts, diminishes
                    appearance of scars, refined skin pores, renewed elasticity, and a healthy glow.
                    Microdermabrasion may be recommended for those with chemical densities and can be used
                    on most skin colors and types, although there are some contraindications. Ask your skin care
                    professional if microdermabrasion is right for you.</p>
