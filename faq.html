            <h4>Where did the name lucid lotus come from?</h4>
            <p class="mb-5">Lucid means bright or luminous. The Lotus flower is regarded in many different cultures
as a symbol of purity, enlightenment, self-regeneration and rebirth. Its characteristics
are a perfect analogy for the human condition: even when its roots are in the dirtiest
waters, the Lotus produces the most beautiful flower. May we be like the Lotus.</p>

            <h4>What are the benefits of massage therapy?</h4>
            <ol class="mb-5">
              <li>Relieves stress and promotes an overall feeling of relaxation</li>
              <li>Alleviates pain and tension, and helps you manage pain better</li>
              <li>Decreases inflammation</li>
              <li>Promotes speedy recovery from injuries</li>
              <li>Increases mobility, provides more joint flexibility</li>
              <li>Improves circulation</li>
              <li>Improves and strengthens immune system</li>
              <li>Relieves musculoskeletal problems and improves posture</li>
              <li>Reduces anxiety and promotes an overall feeling of well-being</li>
              <li>Increases body awareness</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>What should I expect during my first massage therapy visit?</h4>
            <p class="mb-5">You will be required to fill out a Client Intake Form and sign a HIPAA
Acknowledgement form. Afterward, the therapist will begin by asking you general questions to
establish what areas you like worked on, if there are any conditions needing to be addressed,
and determine if massage Is appropriate for you. It is important to list all health concerns and
medications so the therapist can adapt the session to your specific needs without doing any
harm. It is also important to list any allergies so the therapist is aware if she needs to use a
different oil during the session.</p>

            <h4>What is included in the session time?</h4>
            <p class="mb-5">A session consists of massage, time for you to dress and undress and time to
communicate with the therapist to make your massage truly customized. This is done to
ensure each and every massage session you receive from Lucid Lotus meets or exceeds your
expectations.</p>

            <h4>How early should I arrive for my treatment?</h4>
            <p>New clients should arrive 10 minutes prior to their massage to fill out paperwork
and meet with their therapist prior to the treatment. Returning clients should arrive 5 minutes
prior to their session.</p>

<h4>Which massage is right for me?</h4>
<p class="mb-5">Every day can be different. Talk with your therapist to discover which modality is
best for you at that time.</p>

<h4>Do I have to be completely undressed?</h4>
<p class="mb-5">You should undress to the level you are comfortable with. For a full body
massage, most get completely undressed. However, if you will be more comfortable during
session leaving your underwear on, that is fine. The therapist will work around the clothes you
left on as best as they can. If removing all your clothes makes you too nervous and unable to
relax, then you are not getting the optimal benefit from the session. Your massage therapist will
step out of the room to give you privacy to undress and get comfortable on the table. You will
be draped the entire time.</p>

<h4>Do I have to cover myself with a sheet or towel?</h4>
<p class="mb-5">In Oregon State, draping is mandatory. Its the law. Once you are undressed and
on the table under the drape, the therapist will only uncover the part of your body being
worked on. The genitals and breasts will not be uncovered. If the therapist is going to work on
the abdomen, a second sheet will be used to cover the breasts so the main sheet can be
moved to expose the abdomen.</p>


<h4>What do I do during a massage treatment?</h4>
<p class="mb-5">Make yourself comfortable. Communicate any boundaries. If your therapist
wants you to adjust your position, she will either move you or will ask you to move what is
needed. Otherwise, change your position anytime to make yourself more comfortable.
Many people close their eyes and relax completely during a sessions; others
prefer to talk. It’s completely up to you. It is your massage, and whatever feels natural to you is
the best way to relax. Do not hesitate to ask questions at any time.</p>


<h4>Can I talk during my session?</h4>
<p>Sure, if you’d like to talk go right ahead. The important thing to remember is that
this treatment is all about you relaxing and enjoying the experience. Many therapist discourage
talking in hopes that you will relax, let your mind float free and enter a state of massage bliss.
In many instances, people may feel more relaxed starting off talking, and as the
massage progresses, enter quiet states of relaxation.</p>
<p class="mb-5">Most importantly, there are times when you need to speak up. If the therapist is
doing anything to make you uncomfortable, you should let her know immediately. Also, let her
know if you get too warm or too cold, if the room is too bright, or if the pressure needs to be
changed (lighter or deeper). If something is not working for you, please speak up! This is a safe
space.</p>



<h4>Will the massage hurt?</h4>
<p class="mb-5">This depends on the type of massage and the depth of the strokes. A light,
relaxing massage that does not probe very deep into the muscles, should not hurt. With that
being said, there is a “feels good” hurt and an “ouch, stop it” hurt. A good massage, even a
really deep tissue massage, should always stay in the “feels good” hurt range.
Pain can be an indication that the muscle is possible injured or inflamed and
pressure should be adjusted. Also, pain can cause you to tighten up and negate the relaxing
effects of the massage. The most effective and deepest massage always works with your
body’s natural response, not against it. If you are able to breathe through the pressure, you are
generally safe.</p>


<h4>How often should I get a massage?</h4>
<p>“Something is better than nothing.” What does that mean? Well, it varies from
person to person. If you are just looking for some occasional relaxation, then a session every
3-6 weeks may be fine for you. However, if you are looking to address a specific condition,
then it is recommended to go more frequently at first and then slowly taper down to a
maintenance schedule. Sometimes, more frequent 60 minute sessions can be effective until
your goals are met and a maintenance schedule is in place.</p>
<p class="mb-5">Frequency of sessions should be discussed with your massage therapist after
your treatment when she has a better hands-on understanding of your particular muscular
issues.</p>



<h4>When should I not get a massage?</h4>
<p>There are a few conditions which would prevent you from enjoying massage.
You should not book a massage if you have a fever, cold/flu, or contagious skin infection.
That’s it.</p>
<p class="mb-5">There are many other conditions in which your therapist may need to adapt his/
her techniques (i.e. arthritis or osteoporosis) or avoid an area completely (i.e., cuts or burns).
With some conditions, it is a good idea to get approval from your physician before you receive
massage (cancer, certain heart conditions, pregnancy). This does not meant you cannot get a
massage. But it’s always better to be cautious. Your therapist can advise you about your
specific needs.</p>



<h4>How will I feel after my massage treatment?</h4>
<p>Most people feel very relaxed or “massage wasted”. Some experience a
significant decrease or freedom from long-term aches and pains. Many feel a little slowed
down for a short period an then notice an increase of energy, heightened awareness and
increased productivity which can last for days.</p>
<p>If you received a deep tissue massage, you may be slightly sore the next day,
much like a good workout at the gym. Sometimes a hot shower, or hot epsom salt soak in the
tub can ease this soreness.</p>
<p class="mb-5">After your session, you should increase your water intake. Just a glass or two
more than normal is usually fine. This helps keep your body’s tissues hydrated and healthy, as
well as flushing out any toxins that may have been distributed throughout the body during the
massage.</p>

<h4>Why should I see an esthetician?</h4>
<p class="mb-5">Esthetics is the application of various treatments to the skin, to maintain its
health and vitality. Esthetician’s are trained in skin wellness, helping their clients balance oil and
moisture content and achieve a healthy, youthful complexion. Hair removal techniques are also
used. A variety of treatments and products are used to protect skin from environmental
hazards and combat fine lines, wrinkles, and a dull uneven skin tone. Esthetician’s are also
skilled in managing conditions such ass acne, rosacea, eczema, and dry skin to name a few.
And finally, skin care treatments are wonderfully relaxing and rejuvenating. If smooth, healthy
skin is your goal, visiting a skin care professional can be super beneficial for you!</p>


<h4>What’s the difference between dermatology and esthetics?</h4>
<p class="mb-5">Dermatology is a branch of the medical profession, practices by licensed
physicians who specialize in disorders of the skin. Esthetic practice specifically excludes
diagnosis, prescription, or any other service, procedure, or therapy that requires a medical
license. If you’re being treated by a dermatologist, your esthetician can provided
complementary and support therapies.. In addition, estheticians are trained to recognize early
signs of many medical conditions affecting the skin, and will refer you to a dermatologist in
such a case.</p>


<h4>What is a facial? Why do I need one?</h4>
<p>A facial is a professional cleansing, purifying, and beautifying treatment of the
skin on the face and neck, or back. Facials are the number one treatment performed by
estheticians, and a good way for your therapist to get a good understanding of your skin prior
to suggesting more aggressive treatments.</p>
<p class="mb-5">For most people, facials can be scheduled every four weeks, although your therapist
may recommend a different schedule. There are many variations of facials base on different
needs, as well as different lengths of time.</p>



<h4>How do I prepare for a facial?</h4>
<p class="mb-5">Be sure to allow enough time to fill out a comprehensive intake form prior to
your treatment. Plan to arrive a little early so you will not feel rushed and can enjoy the entire
length of your treatment. Remember that your hair may become damp during the facial, and
will usually be held back from your face with a soft wrap or headband. You may not want to
schedule a public appearance right after your facial! Makeup will be cleansed off during the
facial.</p>


<h4>What should I expect?</h4>
<p>Facials are generally very relaxing and soothing. Your esthetician will explain to
you what the treatment steps will be. Be sure to communicate with your esthetician during the
fatal if any product burns, itches, or if you need anything or have any questions. Otherise, just
lie back and enjoy the experience. A basic facial generally includes the following steps:</p>
<ol class="mb-5">
  <li>Makeup removal and cleansing of the skin</li>
  <li>Skin analysis</li>
  <li>Exfoliation by mechanical, enzymatic or chemical means</li>
  <li>Massage of the face and neck, to aid in relaxation and stimulate blood and
  oxygen flow to the skin</li>
  <li>Extraction of blackheads and other impurities, either manually (using gloved
  hands and cotton or tissue with around the fingers with gentle pressure to remove the
  impacted pore) or using a metal extraction implement designed to clear blocked pores. This
  can also include the use of a lancet (a small, sharp blade to lift the dead cells of the skin prior
  to extraction)</li>
  <li>Application of products targets to your skin type (dry, mixed, sensitive or mature)</li>
</ol>
<p ></p>

<h4>What about after the facial?</h4>
<p class="mb-5">After the facial, your skin will probably be soft, smooth and well hydrated.
However, if multiple extractions were needed or if you required a fair amount of exfoliation, your
face may be somewhat rosy for one to two hours or more, depending on how sensitive your
skin is. This is quite normal. You can apply mineral makeup after your facial if there is some
redness you want to conceal.</p>


<h4>What is microdermabrasion, and how will I benefit from it?</h4>
<p>Microdermabrasion is a mechanical exfoliation that uses a machine to remove
dead surface soil cells and initiate cellular turnover. It was first adopted in Europe in the 1980s
and was introduced to the US in the late 1990s. Its introduction led the revolution of devicedriven,
noninvasive cosmetic procedures. Today, microdermabrasion remains one of the most
popular services employed in both medical and day spas.</p>
<p>At Lucid Lotus, I use a diamond tip method. It uses a diamond tipped wand to
sand and resurface the skin, combined with suction to remove the dead skin cells. It stimulates
blood circulation and revitalizes collagen production, which promotes younger looking skin.
The degree of exfoliation depends on the number of passes, coarseness of the diamond wand,
the pressure and suction used, and the frequency of treatment.</p>
<p class="mb-5">Microdermabrasion can be helpful to treat aging and sun-damaged skin, altered
pigmentation, fine lines and wrinkles, stretch marks, some types of acne, and scarring. It is
especially effective in treating the under-eye area and crow’s feet. Results may include
improved skin tone, reduced visual appearance of aging, fewer breakouts, diminishes
appearance of scars, refined skin pores, renewed elasticity, and a healthy glow.
Microdermabrasion may be recommended for those with chemical densities and can be used
on most skin colors and types, although there are some contraindications. Ask your skin care
professional if microdermabrasion is right for you.</p>

<h4>What about home care?</h4>
<p>Much of the success of maintaining a visible improvement after treatment
depends on consistent, correct home care. Your esthetician is trained to select the products
that will most benefit your skin, and to advise you on how to maintain your professional results
between visits. Like medical or dental care, following the right daily regimen at home is
essential if you are to get the most of your visits to a professional.</p>
